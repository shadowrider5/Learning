### 🎯 What I Studied Today
- Course: Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
- Topics Covered:
    - Section 11: [Functions]


### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- function (name, parameters, return type, body)
- pass by value
- default arguments
- overloading functions
  - careful when using default arguments with overloading
- if we pass an array we pass a pointer to the first element so it's not a copy
- use const to make sure we don't change the array
- we pass the size with the array
- pass by reference: changes the same variable, sometimes use it to avoid copying large objects


### 👨‍💻 Code Practice
- projects made: `section11_challenge`
- What I practiced:
    - [Functions, pass by value, pass by reference, default arguments, overloading functions]


### ❓ Question Log
- what does round return
  - a double
- default arguments
- which is better use default arguments in function prototypes or function definitions
  - function prototypes
