### 🎯 What I Studied Today
- Course: Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
- Topics Covered:
  - Section 7: [Arrays and Vectors]


### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
--section 7:
- Arrays:
  - Fixed-size, store elements of the same type.
  - Accessed using an index, starting from 0.
  - Example: `int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};` or {0} all 0
  - Multidimensional arrays: `int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};`
- Vectors:
  - Flexible size, elements of the same type.
  - Part of the C++ Standard Library, included via `#include <vector>`.
  - Example: `std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`
  - vector <int> n (5, 10); // vector of size 5 initialized to 10
  - we use . methods like .at(), .push_back() etc.
- std::array<int, 3> a = {1, 2, 3};

### ❓ Question Log
- when to use arrays vs vectors? and are vectors better at everything than arrays?
