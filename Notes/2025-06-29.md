### 🎯 What I Studied Today
- Course: Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
- Topics Covered:
    - Section 10: [Characters and Strings]


### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
--section 10:
- #include <cctype> for character functions (refer to documentation)
- c-style strings: array of characters ending with a null character `\0`
- if you initialize an array using a string literal, and you allocate more space the extra space is filled with `\0`
  - if not only 1 null is added at the end
- if you don't initialize the array it will not end with `\0` and the assignment will not work
- strlen returns size_t type, which is an unsigned integer type
- cin.getline(variable, number of max chars to read) reads a line of text into a character array(string)
- c++ strings: include <string> and use std::string
- dynamic size ,can be coverted to c-style string if needed
- string initializations 
  - std::string str1 ["Hello"};
  - std::string str2 {str1}; // copy
  - std::string str3 {std::move(str1)}; // move
  - std::string str4 {"Hello", 3}; // first 3 characters
  - std::string str5 {"Hello", 2, 3}; // 2nd character, 3 characters long
  - std::string str6 (10, 'x'); // 10 characters of 'x'
- use normal operators for assignment and other operations
- you can use the .at() method
- can use the range-based for loop like the vector
- c++ functions for strings:
  - .length() or .size() for length
  - .empty() to check if empty
  - .append() to add to the end
  - .insert() to insert at a position
  - .erase() to remove characters
  - .replace() to replace characters
  - .find() to find a substring
  - .substr() to get a substring
  - .c_str() to convert to c-style string
- use getline(cin, variable) or add a delimiter to decide when to stop reading input (cin, var, delimiter)
- check 98 for examples

### ❓ Question Log
- difference between c++ strings and vectors?
  - both can be dynamic, but strings are specifically for text and have many built-in functions for text manipulation
  - vectors are more general-purpose containers for any type of data
