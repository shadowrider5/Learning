  - Section 3: [Overview]
  - Section 4: [Getting Started]

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
--section 1:
- we use IDEs or Editors to make source code which gets translated to object code by the compiler
- we are going to use .cpp and .h files
- linker is responsible for linking object codes to create exe program

--Section 2:
- Setup Compiler (edit the system environment)
- Make `default_project`

--Section 4:
- Make `first_project`
- handle input and output
- compile: create object code from source code
- clean: delete object code
- build: create executable from object code
- errors: [syntax, semantic, logical, runtime, linker]
- Warnings



### 👨‍💻 Code Practice
- projects made: `default_project, first_project, section4_challenge`
- What I practiced:
  - [make a project]
  - [showing information and storing it]
