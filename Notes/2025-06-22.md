### 🎯 What I Studied Today
- Course: Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
- Topics Covered:
  - Section 5: [Structure of a c++ Program]
  - Section 6: [Variables and Constants]


### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
--section 5:
- Keywords, Identifiers, operators, punctuations
- preprocessor: replace comments with space and then execute preprocessor directives(starts with #)
- comments // or /*comments*/
- main uses args if it need commands from the command line
- Namespaces: can create them myself or use another library
- endl flush the stream while "/n" doesn't (endl = "/n" << std::flush)
- how cin works with the buffer 42

--section 6:
- declaring variables (binding variables to memory)
- naming conventions
- initialization (c-like, constructor, c++ list)
- data types(int, float, double, char, bool)
- size of variables 2^size in bits 
- search for variables data types for more info
- Decimal isn't accurate use long double for more precision
- boolean is false when 0 and true when not 0
- literal constants 
- Raw-string literal (R"( ... )")
- used precision to control the output's decimals, EX. cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2) << price;
