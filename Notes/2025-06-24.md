### 🎯 What I Studied Today
- Course: Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
- Topics Covered:
  - Section 8: [Statements and Operators]
  - Section 9: [Controlling Program Flow]


### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
--section 8:
- Expressions: gives a value we can use in functions (Literal, Arithmetic, etc.)
- Statements: full line of code that contains expressions and operators and ends with a semicolon;
- Operators: symbols that perform operations on variables and values (Unary, Binary, Ternary)
- Assignment Operators: used to assign values to variables, e.g., `=`
- Compound Assignment Operators: used to perform an operation and assign the result to a variable
  - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `>>=`, `<<=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=`
- Arithmetic Operators: used to perform mathematical operations, e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- increment and Decrement Operators: `++` and `--`, prefix and postfix
- Type Conversion: converting one data type to another, e.g., `int` to `double`, using static_cast or C-style cast
- equality/Relational Operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<=>`
- use cout << boolalpha; to print boolean values as true/false instead of 1/0 noboolalpha does the opposite
- Logical Operators: `!`, `&&`, `||`  for combining or negating boolean expressions
- R"()" to print with the same format as you typed

--Section 9:
- if statement, if-else statement, if else-if else
- switch statement: only int, char, enum could be used, char take '' and the other no quotes
  - use break after each case to prevent fall-through
- enumerations: example enum Color { red, green, blue }; now u have a data type that only takes these values
- use enum or enum class for improved type safety
- conditional operator (Ternary Operator): `condition ? expression1 : expression2` same job as if-else
- Loops: for, while, do-while, range-based for loop
  - for loop: `for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)`
  - while loop: `while (condition) { statements }`
  - do-while loop: `do { statements } while (condition);` executes at least once
  - range-based for loop: `for (type variable : collection) { statements }` iterates over elements in a collection
    - you can use auto for the type to let the compiler deduce the type
    - you can use a string or vector or directly type your collection
- continue, break
- infinite loops, nested loops
- in multidimensional vectors you can make different sizes for each row

### 👨‍💻 Code Practice
- projects made: `section8_challenge, section9_challenge`
- What I practiced:
  - [Operators]
  - [Loops and Control Flow]


### ❓ Question Log
- can I use strings in switch statements?
    - yes by using enum or enum class for improved type safety
- when do I use a block inside a switch case
  - Declaring variables, avoiding naming conflicts, helps with readability when there are multiple statements
- if I use ++i or i++ in the increment would it matter, or it will be the same since it's not in a statement with other operations
  - for custom types (like iterators, classes) ++it is usually faster than it++, because it++ creates a temporary copy.
  - but for normal types like int, both are the same.
- is there a performance difference between cout << "hello" << "\n"; and cout << "hello\n";
- it's a negligible difference so use whatever is more readable for you.
